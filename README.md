# SMZ3 tracker pack
This is a map & item tracker for the [Super Metroid + A Link to the Past Casual randomizer](https://vivelin.net/projects/smz3) by Vivelin to use with [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net).  It has full item and map tracking support, as well as autotracking on supported platforms.

## My changes
- Changed tracker SM logic to follow the randomizer logic.
- Removed hard logic, because this is a Casual randomizer.
- Added locations for SM 4 bosses.
- Added config "items" section in tracker for the randomizer options.

## Thanks
Dorkmaster Flek - Current developer of the main tracker package.

Gilgatex - The original author of this pack.  Without him, none of this would be possible so huge thanks!

Ninban - Took over managing this pack after Gilgatex until now.  Many thanks!
