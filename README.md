# SMZ3 tracker pack
This is a map & item tracker for the [Super Metroid + A Link to the Past Casual randomizer](https://vivelin.net/projects/smz3) by Vivelin to use with [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net).  It has full item and map tracking support, as well as autotracking on supported platforms.

It's mainly changes in logic to match the casual changes made to the randomizer.

## Thanks

Gilgatex - The original author of this pack.  Without him, none of this would be possible so huge thanks!
